## Notes
Loose notetaking following the guidelines in Chapter 1.
### Questions
- How did Georgeâ€™s manager acquire the disk?
  - Since Montgomery used a company laptop, hsi superiors have the right to investigate the device.
  - The manager likely made a bit-stream copy of Montgomery's disk.

- Did George perform the work on a laptop, which is his own property? If so, did he conduct business transactions on his break or during his lunch hour?
  - No, Geoge did not use his own laptop, metadata suggests that the computer is part of the organization Starships CMS.
    - Further, document owners are Amelia Phillips, which could suggest that Phillips is the true owner of the computer.

- At what times of the day was George using the non-work-related files? How did you retrieve this information?
  - Documents were modified around 14:50 CST (2:50 pm). The addresses in Billing Letter.doc indicate that Montgomery operates out of Washington, so documents were modified at 12:50 pm in the local time zone. This makes it plausible that Montgomery was conducting business transactions during his lunch hour.
    - This information was found in the metadata section of the HTML Report.

- Which company policies apply?
  - Use of company propery

- Are there any other items that need to be considered?
  - There is a document (letter1.txt) addressed to Earl, a name that doesn't appear in the Client Info.mdb or Income.xls documents. Despite not being listed as a client, Montgomery indicates that he is working for Earl. I personally find this suspicious, but it could be irrelevant to the case.
  - In Montgomery's message to Laura Roper in Billing Statement.doc, he gives Roper a 30 day time limit to pay him before he sells the domain. This is reminiscent of tactics used by scammers to panic their victims into paying them.
  - The document confirmation.txt contains the following sensitive information:
